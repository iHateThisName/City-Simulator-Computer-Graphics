# City-Simulator
We've created a city simulator with the help of WebGL based technology.
This consisted of creating a web app to support visualization of spatiotemporal urban data.

## How to run

Open the index.html file in a supported browser of your choice,
or run 'live-server' in the terminal.

## Usage
Once you've run the project, you're presented with a web app containing our whole scene.

You will be able to orbit around the scene, as well as zooming in and out.

On the lefthand side, you're able to add and delete neighborhoods with its buildings
in the scene by choosing which from "1" to "10".

In the top left corner, you're able to change the sun's position by adjusting the sliders
named 'inclination' and 'azimuth' depending on which direction you want to adjust.
